# Python PDF Tools
A collection of tools I made to manipulate PDF tools with using the PyPDF2 library.

I've found that the most useful ones are Join.py, Extract.py, and Split.py. I've used these programs a lot, with all our assignments being online. They're especially useful for composing project reports.
